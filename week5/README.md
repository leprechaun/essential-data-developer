## What will I learn?
* Big Data Engineering - Introduction + stack.
* Processing data using Spark and Data Bricks.
* Spark Architecture, Joins, Partionining.
* Spark Tools like Spark Submit, Spark UI.
* Data Pipelines - Batch vs Streams.
* Common Data Architecture Patterns.

## What should I learn in weekend?
1. Watch (˜1 hrs)

    * [a-beginners-guide-to-data-engineering-part-ii](https://medium.com/@rchang/a-beginners-guide-to-data-engineering-part-ii-47c4e7cbda71.) 
    * [a-beginners-guide-to-data-engineering-part-iii](https://medium.com/@rchang/a-beginners-guide-to-data-engineering-the-series-finale-2cc92ff14b0)

3. Exercise to do(˜2-3 hrs)
    * Setup DataBricks and go though below.
    * [If you need help setting up Data Bricks Notebooks](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1u30BJyCtWpoPwAlkb5bJqjfZOdXglAic)
    * [Data Bricks Getting Started](https://docs.databricks.com/getting-started/index.html)
    * [Spark - Architectures, joins, partitioning](https://docs.databricks.com/getting-started/spark/index.html)

## What will we do in Guild?
1. Discussions on what we have learned so far...
2. Read and Discuss
    * [Data Concepts](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/128NUUBcyFkSp0Y4lNWxFzFhXENIZHuT2bzhIcBZJcMM/edit#slide=id.g3bd0ed69af_1_558)

3. Exercise
    * [Checkout](./batch-data-pipeline) and explore sample batch data pipeline in this codebase.
    * [Run Spark submit locally](./running_spark_submit_locally.md).
    * [Setup Spark UI locally and explore](./running_spark_ui_locally.md).


## What if I want to know more!?
* [Scala](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/scala-for-java-programmers.html) might be enough for the basic syntax level  understanding of Scala.
Also, [please follow these instructions to set up IntelliJ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18gdtnyQ4Ze5UnvAVVCN-GkNxvV2aNHR_LNyh0kDTq4A/edit#heading=h.pgupim5kxzr0) for Scala.
* [Processing tools selection criteria](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fTfEkbRb8uwFuPu-kuwbASmMyHOxzzz8hySY1Qit2Ig/edit#slide=id.g37231d4ee1_0_198)
* [the-data-infrastructure-meta-analysis-how-top-engineering-organizations-built-their-big-data-stacks](https://www.stitchdata.com/blog/the-data-infrastructure-meta-analysis-how-top-engineering-organizations-built-their-big-data-stacks/)
* Excellent coverage on Spark by [Sameer Farooqui](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ooZ4S7Ay6Y)
* Recent and excellent book  - [Spark definitive guide](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/spark-the-definitive/9781491912201/)
