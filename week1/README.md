# Week 1: Simplified Data Science Workflow

In this week, we will learn very minimum basic knowledge in order to get to select the right features for building simple machine learning model which will be a classification problem.

## What will I learn?

* Basic Python Data Science Toolbox
* Understand Data Types
* How to deal with missing values
* Machine Learning
  * Introduction
  * Classification
  * Validation
  * Underfitting / Overfitting

## What should I learn on weekend?

* [Data Ingestion and Inspection](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/pandas-foundations/data-ingestion-inspection) (~ 1 hour)
* [Data Types](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-types-in-statistics-347e152e8bee) (~ 6 mins)
* Missing values
  * [Idea](https://www.analyticsindiamag.com/5-ways-handle-missing-values-machine-learning-datasets/)
  * [Python specific](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.04-missing-values.html ))
* [Graphical Exploratory Data Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/rochellesilva/simple-tutorial-for-beginners/data) (~ 1 hour)
  * Try out additional plots and think about when will it be useful
    * [distplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.distplot.html)
    * [heatmap](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.heatmap.html)
    * [barplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.barplot.html)
    * [scatterplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.scatterplot.html)
* [Machine Learning: Classification](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/supervised-learning-with-scikit-learn/classification)
  * More classification algorithm
    * [Decision Tree](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/decision-tree-classification-python)

## What will we do in Guild?

* Discuss about what you have learned
* Let's predict if a Titanic passenger will survive or not ([data](https://www.kaggle.com/rochellesilva/simple-tutorial-for-beginners/data))

## What if I want to know more!?
