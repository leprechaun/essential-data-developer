# Week 1: Simplified Data Science Workflow

In this week, we will learn very minimum basic knowledge in order to get to select the right features for building simple machine learning model which will be a classification problem.

## What will I learn?

* Basic Python Data Science Toolbox
* Understand Data Types
* How to deal with missing values
* Machine Learning
  * Introduction
  * Classification
  * Validation
  * Underfitting / Overfitting

## What should I learn on weekend?

* [Try to setup local environment](setup.md) (~ 10 mins)
* [Data Ingestion and Inspection](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/pandas-foundations/data-ingestion-inspection) (~ 1 hour)
* [Data Types](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-types-in-statistics-347e152e8bee) (~ 6 mins)
* Missing values
  * [Handling missing values](https://www.analyticsindiamag.com/5-ways-handle-missing-values-machine-learning-datasets/)
  * [Python specific missing values and how to handle it](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.04-missing-values.html ))
* [Graphical Exploratory Data Analysis](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/statistical-thinking-in-python-part-1/graphical-exploratory-data-analysis) (~ 1 hour)
* Try out more plot type (~ 30 mins)
  * [distplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.distplot.html)
  * [heatmap](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.heatmap.html)
  * [barplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.barplot.html)
  * [scatterplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.scatterplot.html)
  * What is each of them good at? What can it tell us?
* [Machine Learning: Classification](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/supervised-learning-with-scikit-learn/classification) (~ 1 hour)
  * More classification algorithm (~ 30 mins)
    * [Decision Tree](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/decision-tree-classification-python)

## What will we do in Guild?

* Discuss about what you have learned
* Let's predict if a Titanic passenger will survive or not ([data](https://www.kaggle.com/rochellesilva/simple-tutorial-for-beginners/data))

## What if I want to know more!?

* [Think Stats (Book)](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/think-stats-2nd/9781491907344/) More on Exploratory Data Analysis using tools of probability and statistics in Python
* [Python Graph Gallery](https://python-graph-gallery.com/) Gallery of how can we plot stuffs
