# Week 3: Statistics for Data Science

## What will I learn?

This week we will focus on basic linear algebra and statistics just enough to be
able to understand machine learning algorithms and gaining more confidence on
your approach to data science problems.

## What should I learn in weekend?

* Essence of Linear Algebra (~1 hour)
  * [Vectors, what even are they?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=2&t=0s)
  * [Linear combinations, span, and basis vectors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7RM-ot2NWY&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=2)
  * [Linear transformations and matrices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=3)
  * [Change of basis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2LTAUO1TdA&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=12)
  * [Eigenvectors and eigenvalues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFDu9oVAE-g&index=13&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)

* Statistics (TBA)


## What will we do in Guild?

Let's discuss about what we have learned and how to use it to solve real world problems!

## What if I want to know more!?
