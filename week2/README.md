# Week 2 : More on Machine Learning and Feature Engineering

## What will I learn?

We have talked about Machine Learning a bit last week. This week, we will dive deeper into what Machine Learning really is and more 

* Proper introduction to Machine Learning
* Other types of machine learning apart from classification:
  * Regression
  * Clustering
  * Dimensionality Reduction
* Using machine learning for exploration
* Feature Engineering
  * Feature Selection
