# Week 2 : More ML! Because why not?

We have talked about Machine Learning a bit last week. This week, we will dive deeper into Machine Learning, more types of machine learning algorithms for solving different problems. And also talk about Feature Engineering which we actually have done some last week!

## What will I learn?

* Feature Engineering: In the activity in the week1, after we explore our data, we see some pattern, some correlation, and that guide us to select and transform feature with the hope that the model we build will yield better result. In this week, let's learn the ideas that people use to do sophisticated feature engineering!
* Proper introduction to Machine Learning: Last week we learned about classification, but what's about others? Let's find out!
* Other types of machine learning apart from classification:
  * Regression
  * Clustering
  * Dimensionality Reduction
* Using machine learning for exploration

## What should I learn in weekend?

## What will we do in Guild?

TBA

## What if I want to know more!?

* [Machine Learning on Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud262): This contains lots of concepts around machine learning, including more advance feature engineering as well (In Feature Selection and Feature Transformation lessons)
* [Aritificial Intelligence: Representation and Problem Solving](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15381-f17/)
* [Thoughtful Machine Learning: A Test-Driven Approach](https://www.amazon.com/Thoughtful-Machine-Learning-Test-Driven-Approach/dp/1449374069)
