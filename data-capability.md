# Data Capability

In [self-assessment for data related capability](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeYHRP3Tm04r9BZOL1G4YfXyF2dN4VNib2LtlB0f46TPnHCRw/viewform), it categorize data capability into 5 buckets. Which seems to be a good reference for us to think about how are we going to grow data capabilities.


### Data Strategy

The ability to uncover data opportunities and guide the vision for transforming organizations to become data-led.

Key Competencies: 

  1. **Data driven approaches**: Understands business strategy and organizational data-ecosystem and proposes different approaches that use data to improve organizational capability

  2. **Data governance**: Managing data at an enterprise level - What are the various rules and regs in the industry that apply to the info you are storing. Best practices in terms of capturing and storing information. How should information be shared across the enterprise. What checks should be in place. How do you communicate a canonical model across the enterprise

  3. **Responsible data**: Understanding and preventing bias. Understanding what is encoded into systems

  4. **Data security strategy**: How do you share information across the enterprise while keeping in consideration appropriate information security for the data. Datensparsamkeit. Data encryption options. Data sanitization (removing PII, PHI, and other sensitive information)


### Data Insights

The ability to gain insights from data to inform decision making, including descriptive and diagnostic analytics.

Key Competencies: 

  1. **Business Intelligence**: Architectures and analysis techniques to derive business insights from data. Includes data warehousing, reporting, multidimensional modeling, and ETL

  2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understanding how to analyze datasets and summarize their main characteristics using visual or statistical methods

  3. **Math & Stats**: Linear algebra, Calculus, Probability theory (probability distribution, conditional probability, Bayes theorem), descriptive statistics, percentiles and outliers, Monte Carlo method


### Machine Intelligence

The ability to combine machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to create systems that exhibit intelligent behavior.

Key Competencies:

  1. **Machine Learning**: Classification, Clustering, Prediction and Regression, Dimensionality Reduction, Anomaly Detection, Neural Networks (inc. Deep Learning), Reinforcement Learning, Predictive and Prescriptive analytics Foundational skills (inc. Feature Eng., Model Eval., Ensemble Learning)

  2. **Text & natural language processing**: Translation, Sentiment Analysis, Syntax Analysis, Summarization, Search, Named-entity recognition

  3. **Speech and voice**: Speech to Text, Text to Speech

  4. **Computer vision**: Image Recognition, Video Recognition, Machine Vision

  5. **Optimization, scheduling and planning**: Genetic Algorithms, Convex Optimization, Particle Swarm Optimization (inc. ant colony optimization)

  6. **Graph network analysis**: Community Detection, Social Network Analysis
  

### Data Platform Engineering

The ability to design and build data platforms, from which people can gain insights.

Key Competencies: 

  1. **Data Pipeline**: Change Data Capture (CDC), ETL, Ingesting data from different sources, understanding file formats and storage options, developing data pipelines, Management of data flow.

  2. **Data Architecture**: Choosing how to design storage choices. Defining data exchange formats. Whether to use streaming or batch architectures.

  3. **Data Storage**: Understanding different types of databases (RDBMS, Document, Key/Value, Graph, Columnar, Distributed File System) and when to use them.

  4. **Data Processing**: Performing operations on top of data. Using Streaming, batch, or micro-batch technologies, MapReduce. Functional Programming.

  5. **Data Modeling**: Designing how to store data in different types of databases. E.g. relational schema design for RDBMS, aggregate root for document store, graph topology for graph store, file formats for distributed file system


### User Experience Around Insights

The ability to apply user centered design to understand what problems can be solved using data insights.

Key Competencies:

  1. **Data-driven views**: Build visualizations on top of data that provide insightful information for decision making

  2. **Data Storytelling**: Communicating data insights using visualizations, data, and a compelling narrative
