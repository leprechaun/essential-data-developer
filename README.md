# Essential Data Developer

We have made a speculation that developing a data-centric product still need strong software engineering skill like any other software product in order to make it sustainable and evolvable while also having understanding around data science and engineering. Like when we call someone a full-stack developer, they tend to be very good in some area, front-end for example, but also have enough knowledge around other things to be able to contribute to those area and enable smoother communication.

Data Developer is a person who have background in software development plus some foundational knowledge in data space. They don't need to be very good at everything, but should know enough about how to deal with data. In Data Guild, we plan to groom our people into Data Developer so that they have enough basics to be able to contribute in a data project right away and be able to learn more about specific topic further themselves.
