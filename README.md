# Introduction

## Essential Data Developer

We have made a speculation that developing a data-centric product still need strong software engineering skill like any other software product in order to make it sustainable and evolvable while also having understanding around data science and engineering. Like when we call someone a full-stack developer, they tend to be very good in some area, front-end for example, but also have enough knowledge around other things to be able to contribute to those area and enable smoother communication.

Data Developer is a person who have background in software development plus some foundational knowledge in data space. They don't need to be very good at everything, but should know enough about how to deal with data. With the help of Data Scientist and Data Engineer, they should be able to build a good data product.

In Data Guild, we plan to groom our people into Data Developer so that they have enough basics to be able to contribute in a data project right away and be able to learn more about specific topic further themselves.

### Essential Data Developer Pathway

So, we should now be on the same page around intention of this program. Let's define a minimum set of capabilities we need for becoming a Data Developer!

We will use this list of [Data Capability](data-capability.md) as a baseline and we will focus on a few of them.

The goal here is to move from **No experience** to **Learning** stage in the selected key competencies as defined in [Learning Pathways](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JCEcE9OmQ1ocdxKf37gzNtWmC63xaBMEs-uFUQ_8LJA/edit#slide=id.g3fa2669660_5_1831):

> **Learning**
>
> Novice, apprentice. Trying to learn fundamentals via self-guided learning, support from a coach/mentor/teammates or other learning resources. Starting to apply new knowledge in a professional setting by working from a checklist or playbook.

## How are we going to do it?

This program will last for 8 weeks. Each week we are going to ask you to do some homework beforehand, and then we can have discussion and hack together at the guild!

For the first 4 weeks we are going to focus on Data Science and a bit of Data BA, which will include:

[**Data Strategy**](data-capability.md/#data-strategy)
- Data driven approaches

* Data driven approaches

**Data Insights**

* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Math & Stats

**Machine Intelligence**

* Machine Learning

And for the last 4 weeks, it will be more Data Engineering and a bit of Data UX. We will cover:

**Data Platform Engineering**

* Data Pipeline
* Data Architecture
* Data Storage
* Data Processing
* Data Modeling

**User Experience Around Insights**

* Data Storytelling
